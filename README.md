# Summary

The Bifold Wallet is an open-source project designed to enhance the way we interact with digital identities, making the process both secure and user-friendly. It is based on React Native, which lets it run smoothly on different devices and platforms, such as iOS, and Android. It is a leading example of digital wallets, with a focus on making verifiable credentials (VCs) simple and convenient for everyone. Our mission is to create a collaborative community that enhances the way digital credentials are handled, making them accessible and straightforward for all.
